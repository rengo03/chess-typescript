# Simple Chess Game with TypeScript

In both chess and web development, success requires careful planning and foresight, an ability to anticipate and respond to challenges, and a constant drive to improve and adapt.
This project was a great chance for me to expand my understanding about Object-Oriented Programming and my skills as a web developer and bring my passion for chess to life.
I used React to build the user interface, including the chessboard and the pieces, and TypeScript to add type checking and ensure the code was clean and well-organized.
I also made sure to pay close attention to the details of the game, such as the rules of movement for each piece and the proper display of the game state. I used TypeScript to enforce strict typing and catch any errors before they became problems.
